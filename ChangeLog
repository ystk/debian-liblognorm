----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.1, 2014-04-11
- improved doc (via RST/Sphinx)
- bugfix: unparsed fields were copied incorrectly from non-terminated
  string. Thanks to Josh Blum for the fix.
- bugfix: mandatory tag did not work in lognormalizer
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.0.0, 2013-11-28
- WARNING: this version has incompatible interface and older programs 
  will not compile with it.
  For details see http://www.liblognorm.com/news/on-liblognorm-1-0-0/
- libestr is not used any more in interface functions. Traditional
  C strings are used instead. Internally, libestr is still used, but
  scheduled for removal.
- libee is not used any more. JSON-C is used for object handling
  instead. Parsers and formatters are now part of liblognorm.
- added new field type "rest", which simply sinks all up to end of
  the string.
- added support for glueing two fields together, without literal 
  between them. It allows for constructs like:
  %volume:number%%unit:word%
  which matches string "1000Kbps"
- Fix incorrect merging of trees with empty literal at end
  Thanks to Pavel Levshin for the patch
- this version has survived many bugfixes
